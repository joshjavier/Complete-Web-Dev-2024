  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm Josh! I'm a front-end developer with a passion for creating visually engaging and user-friendly web experiences. Currently, I'm expanding my skills to become a full-stack developer, diving deeper into both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

  <p>When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me watching horror movies, climbing rocks at the bouldering gym, or tackling a challenging puzzle. I'm always looking for new ways to blend creativity and logic, both in my work and my hobbies.</p>

  <p>I'm currently studying &ldquo;The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp&rdquo; by Dr Angela Yu on Udemy. Join me on my coding journey!</p>
